**About**

CropFit empowers farmers with AI-driven insights for better crop yield and sustainable farming. By entering soil parameters such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall, users can get:

Recommended crop to plant.

Suggested fertilizer for optimal growth.

**Features**

User-friendly and responsive web interface.

Machine Learning models for accurate predictions:

Naive Bayes â†’ Crop Prediction

Random Forest â†’ Fertilizer Recommendation

Input validation for realistic soil and weather values.

Mobile-friendly with Bootstrap styling
